#   mouse: follow mouse pointer
#   keyboard: follow window with keyboard focus

# _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property.
# This should be the case for almost all modern window managers.

# If this option is set to mouse or keyboard, the monitor option
# will be ignored.

#        simplistic so using this option outside of matching rules for
#        specific applications *IS GREATLY DISCOURAGED*.
#
# no:    Disable markup parsing, incoming notifications will be treated as
#        plain text. Dunst will not advertise that it has the body-markup

### Legacy

# Use the Xinerama extension instead of RandR for multi-monitor support.
# This setting is provided for compatibility with older nVidia drivers that
# do not support RandR and using it on systems that support RandR is highly

# is connected or disconnected which might break follow mode if the screen
# layout changes.

# * open_url: If the notification has exactly one url, open it. If there are multiple
